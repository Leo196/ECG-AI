Class 1 indicates that all ECG significant waveforms (P wave, T wave and QRS complex) are clearly visible and their onsets and offsets can be detected reliably; 
Class 2 indicates that the noise level is increased and ECG significant points cannot be reliably detected, but the signal enables reliable QRS detection; 
Class 3 indicates that QRS complexes cannot be detected reliably and the signal is unsuitable for any further analysis.
